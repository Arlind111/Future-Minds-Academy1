        <h1>Eminem</h1>
        <p>Eminem, byname of Marshall Bruce Mathers III, (born October 17, 1972, St. Joseph, Missouri,
            U.S.), American
            rapper, record producer, and actor who was known as one of the most-controversial and best-selling artists
            of the early 21st century.

            Mathers had a turbulent childhood, marked by poverty and allegations of abuse. At age 14 he began rapping in
            clubs in Detroit, Michigan, and, when unexcused absences kept him in the ninth grade for the third year, he
            quit school, determined to make it in hip-hop music. As Eminem, he made a name for himself in the hip-hop
            underground, both as a solo artist and as a member of the Detroit-based rap sextet D12 (also known as the
            Dirty Dozen). His first album, Infinite (1996), sold poorly, however, and he continued to work menial jobs.
